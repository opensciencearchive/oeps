# Abstract

Open Science Archive Enhancement Proposals (OEPs) are the primary mechanism for proposing new features, collecting community input, and documenting the design decisions that shape the Open Science Archive (OSA) protocol. Because the OSA is a standard intended for long-term preservation and interoperability, OEPs serve as the historical record of the protocol's evolution.

This document defines the OEP process, the role of the OEP Editors, and the workflow for submitting and ratifying proposals.

# Motivation

For the Open Science Archive to succeed as an open, neutral standard, its development must be transparent, inclusive, and rigorous. We cannot rely on implicit knowledge or ad-hoc decisions committed to a codebase.

A formalised proposal process ensures that:
1.  **Design precedes Implementation:** Architectural risks are identified before code is written.
2.  **Rationale is Preserved:** Future maintainers understand *why* a decision was made, preventing Chesterton's Fence violations.
3.  **Ecosystems can Diverge:** By specifying the protocol separately from the reference implementation (Python), we enable compliant implementations in other languages (Rust, Go) and hardware.

# Specification

## OEP Types

There are three primary types of OEPs:

1.  **Technical**
    These describe a new feature or implementation for the OSA protocol. They are normative.

2.  **Informational**
    These describe a design issue, general guidelines, or information to the community, but do not propose a new feature. They do not necessarily represent a community consensus or recommendation.

3.  **Process**
    These describe a process surrounding OSA, or propose a change to (or an event in) a process. They are like Technical OEPs but apply to areas other than the OSA protocol itself (e.g., this document).

## The OEP Lifecycle

The lifecycle of an OEP is managed via the git repository.

### 1. Draft
An OEP begins as a Pull Request (PR) to the `opensciencearchive/oeps` repository. The status in the preamble MUST be set to `draft`. Discussion and iteration happen in the PR comments. The author is responsible for collecting feedback and updating the draft.

### 2. Review
When the author believes the OEP is stable and complete, they request a move to `review`. This signals to the community that the proposal is ready for final scrutiny.

### 3. Accepted
An OEP is `accepted` when the OEP Editors merge the PR into the main branch.

### 4. Withdrawn / Rejected
If a consensus cannot be reached, or the author abandons the proposal, the OEP is marked `withdrawn`. If the Editors deem the proposal technically unsound or misaligned with the OSA mission, it is `rejected`.

### 5. Living
A special status for OEPs that are continuously updated and never finalised (e.g., OEP-0001).

## OEP Format and Template

All OEPs MUST be written in Markdown. The file MUST be located in the `oeps/` directory and named `OEP-XXXX.md`, where `XXXX` is the assigned number (padded with zeros).

### Header Preamble

Each OEP MUST begin with an RFC 822 style YAML header:

```yaml
---
oep: <OEP number, zero-padded>
title: <OEP title>
status: <draft | review | accepted | withdrawn | rejected | living>
type: <technical | informational | process>
author: <list of authors' real names and email addresses>
created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format>
requires: <OEP numbers> (optional)
replaces: <OEP numbers> (optional)
---
```

### Required Sections

*   **Abstract:** A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
*   **Motivation:** The problem description. This section MUST address the *Scientific Context* (why this helps research) separate from the *Technical Context*.
*   **Specification:** The technical syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.
*   **Rationale:** The flesh of the specification. It should describe what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.
*   **Backwards Compatibility:** All OEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The OSA protocol emphasises long-term preservation; breaking changes are strongly discouraged.
*   **Rejected Alternatives:** Explanation of the alternative solutions considered, and the reasons for their rejection.
*   **Security & Privacy:** A discussion of the security and privacy implications of the change.
*   **Open Issues:** Description of the known bugs, future work, or yet-unclarified questions relating to the proposal.

## OEP Editors

The OEP Editors are responsible for the administrative and editorial aspects of the OEP workflow. They do not determine scientific merit, but ensure technical completeness and adherence to the process.

Current Editors:
*   [Your Name] (`your-email@example.com`)

## Auxiliary Files

OEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams, JSON schemas, or example datasets. These files should be placed in a subdirectory named `assets/oep-XXXX/`.

# Rationale

OSA adopts this process to balance the need for rigorous standardisation with the agility required by modern software development.

We examined the processes of **Python (PEPs)**, **Rust (RFCs)**, and **Ethereum (EIPs)**.
*   We adopted the **YAML Preamble** from EIPs for machine readability on the `oeps.opensciencearchive.org` website.
*   We adopted the **Reference Implementation** requirement from Python to ensure no "vaporware" standards are ratified.
*   We added the specific requirement for **Scientific Context** in the Motivation section to ensure the protocol remains grounded in the needs of researchers, not just software engineers.

# Open Issues

*   Should accepted OEPs be given DOIs?
