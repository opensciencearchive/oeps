# Abstract

This OEP explores identifier schemes for resources in the Open Science Archive protocol. Rather than prescribing a specific format, it establishes the requirements that any identifier scheme must satisfy, surveys existing approaches, and proposes one candidate (Structured Resource Names) for community feedback.

# Motivation

Every resource in OSA—Records, Depositions, Vocabularies, Schemas, Validators—needs an identifier. The choice of identifier scheme has far-reaching consequences for the protocol's usability, longevity, and interoperability.

Scientific data archives present unique challenges:

- **Longevity**: Identifiers may be cited in papers for decades
- **Federation**: Multiple independent nodes must avoid collisions
- **Machine use**: Software needs to parse, route, and validate identifiers
- **Human use**: Developers and researchers need to debug and discuss identifiers

Getting this wrong is costly. Changing identifier schemes after deployment breaks existing references.

# Requirements

Any identifier scheme for OSA should satisfy the following properties:

## Must Have

**Globally unique**: Two resources must never share an identifier, even across independent nodes operated by different organizations.

**Resolvable**: Given an identifier, there must be a defined mechanism to retrieve the resource or its metadata.

**Stable**: Once assigned, an identifier must continue to refer to the same resource. Identifiers should not be reassigned or recycled.

## Should Have

**Human-readable**: Developers should be able to understand what an identifier refers to without dereferencing it. At minimum, identifiers should be pronounceable and not excessively long.

**Type-aware**: The identifier should indicate what kind of resource it refers to (Record, Vocabulary, etc.), enabling validation and routing without network calls.

**Version-aware**: For versioned resources, the identifier should support pinning to a specific version.

**Decentralized minting**: Nodes should be able to create identifiers without coordinating with a central authority.

## Nice to Have

**Persistent across migrations**: If an organization changes its domain or infrastructure, existing identifiers should remain valid.

**Content-addressable**: Identifiers could be derived from content hashes, enabling integrity verification and deduplication.

**Compatible with existing standards**: Alignment with URN, DID, DOI, or other established schemes reduces implementation burden and improves interoperability.

# Existing Approaches

## URLs

```
https://archive.example.org/records/abc123
```

**Pros**: Universal, familiar, directly resolvable, existing tooling.

**Cons**: Conflates identity with location. When domains change, URLs break. No built-in versioning or typing.

**Used by**: Most web APIs, many data repositories.

## DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)

```
doi:10.1234/abc.5678
```

**Pros**: Designed for persistence, widely adopted in academia, resolver infrastructure exists (doi.org), citable in papers.

**Cons**: Opaque (no type or origin information), requires registration with a DOI agency (cost, bureaucracy), resolution depends on Handle System (centralized).

**Used by**: Academic publishing, Zenodo, Figshare, DataCite.

## URNs (Uniform Resource Names)

```
urn:isbn:978-3-16-148410-0
urn:ietf:rfc:3986
```

**Pros**: W3C/IETF standard, separates naming from resolution, extensible namespace system.

**Cons**: No universal resolution mechanism (each namespace defines its own), requires IANA registration for formal namespaces.

**Used by**: ISBN, IETF RFCs, various domain-specific schemes.

## DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)

```
did:web:example.org
did:plc:abc123xyz
```

**Pros**: W3C standard, designed for decentralization, supports cryptographic verification, multiple "methods" for different tradeoffs.

**Cons**: Designed for entities (people, organizations) not resources, verbose, emerging ecosystem.

**Used by**: AT Protocol (Bluesky), identity wallets, Verifiable Credentials.

## ARNs (Amazon Resource Names)

```
arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789:bucket/object
```

**Pros**: Proven at scale, encodes region/account/service/resource hierarchy, enables policy-based access control.

**Cons**: AWS-specific, complex syntax, assumes single operator (Amazon).

**Used by**: All AWS services.

## UUIDs

```
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

**Pros**: Trivial to generate, guaranteed unique (v4), no coordination required.

**Cons**: Opaque, no context about resource type or origin, not human-friendly, not directly resolvable.

**Used by**: Databases, internal systems, anywhere uniqueness matters more than readability.

## Content Identifiers (CIDs)

```
bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oca...
```

**Pros**: Derived from content hash, self-verifying, enables deduplication, immutable by design.

**Cons**: Long, not human-readable, requires content to generate identifier, any content change = new identifier.

**Used by**: IPFS, Filecoin, content-addressed storage systems.

# Analysis

| Scheme | Unique | Resolvable | Stable | Readable | Typed | Versioned | Decentralized |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|----------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| URLs | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| DOIs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

✓ = yes, ✗ = no, ◐ = partial/depends

No existing scheme fully satisfies our requirements. This suggests either:

1. Extending an existing scheme (likely URN or DID)
2. Defining a new scheme purpose-built for OSA

# Candidate: Structured Resource Names (SRNs)

One option is to define a URN-based scheme that embeds the properties we need. We propose this as a starting point for discussion, not as a final specification.

## Format

```
urn:osa:{node-id}:{type}:{local-id}[@{version}][#{fragment}]
```

## Components

**`urn:osa:`** — Fixed prefix indicating an OSA identifier.

**`{node-id}`** — The originating node. Options:
- DNS hostname (e.g., `data.imperial.ac.uk`) — simple, enables direct resolution, but breaks if domain changes
- DID (e.g., `did:web:data.imperial.ac.uk`) — more persistent, adds complexity
- Opaque ID with registry lookup — most persistent, requires central infrastructure

**`{type}`** — Resource type: `rec`, `dep`, `vocab`, `schema`, `val`, `tool`.

**`{local-id}`** — Node-assigned identifier, opaque to clients.

**`@{version}`** — Optional version suffix for immutable snapshots.

**`#{fragment}`** — Optional fragment for sub-resources (e.g., vocabulary attributes).

## Examples

```
urn:osa:data.imperial.ac.uk:rec:xyz789@v1
urn:osa:archive.embl.org:vocab:rnaseq@v2.1#mapped-reads-percent
urn:osa:did:web:data.imperial.ac.uk:dep:abc123
```

## Open Questions

**Node identity**: Should node-id be a DNS hostname, a DID, or something else? DNS is simple but fragile. DIDs add persistence but complexity.

**DID integration**: If nodes have DIDs (via `did:web` or similar), should the SRN embed the full DID or just the hostname with an implied DID?

**Registration**: Should `urn:osa` be registered with IANA? This adds legitimacy but bureaucracy.

**Versioning syntax**: Is `@v1` the right format? Alternatives: `/v1`, `?version=1`, separate field.

**Migration**: How should identifiers survive domain changes? Options include redirect protocols, DID-based persistence, or accepting breakage as rare.

# Alternative: DID-Native Approach

Rather than inventing SRNs, we could use DIDs directly:

```
did:osa:data.imperial.ac.uk:rec:xyz789
```

This would require defining a `did:osa` method specifying:
- Identifier format
- Resolution process
- CRUD operations on DID Documents

**Pros**: Aligns with W3C standard, potential interop with Verifiable Credentials, existing DID tooling.

**Cons**: DIDs are designed for entities not resources, would be non-standard usage, more complex resolution.

# Alternative: Minimal Approach

Use simple URLs with conventions:

```
https://data.imperial.ac.uk/osa/records/xyz789/v1
```

Rely on HTTP redirects for persistence. Accept that URLs may break.

**Pros**: Simplest to implement, no new concepts, universal tooling.

**Cons**: Fragile, no type information, conflates identity with location.

# Next Steps

This OEP seeks feedback on:

1. **Requirements**: Are the requirements complete and correctly prioritized?
2. **Existing schemes**: Are there schemes we should consider that aren't listed?
3. **SRN proposal**: Is this a reasonable starting point, or should we pursue a different direction?
4. **Node identity**: What should node-id be? DNS hostname, DID, or hybrid?
5. **Migration**: How important is surviving domain changes? What tradeoffs are acceptable?

Based on community input, a follow-up OEP will specify the chosen scheme in detail.
