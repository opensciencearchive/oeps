# Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

# Motivation

## Scientific Context

Explain why this proposal matters for scientific research and the Open Science Archive mission.

## Technical Context

Describe the technical problem or opportunity this OEP addresses.

# Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

# Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.

# Backwards Compatibility

All OEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The OEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

# Security & Privacy

All OEPs should contain a section that discusses any security or privacy implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.

# Open Issues

While an OEP is in draft status, list any unresolved questions or implementation considerations here.
